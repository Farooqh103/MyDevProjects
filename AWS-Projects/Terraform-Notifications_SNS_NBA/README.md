# NBA Game Day Notifications / Sports Alerts System

## **Project Overview**
This project is an alert system that sends real-time NBA game day score notifications to subscribed users via SMS/Email. It leverages **Amazon SNS**, **AWS Lambda and Python**, **Amazon EvenBridge** and **NBA APIs** to provide sports fans with up-to-date game information. The project demonstrates cloud computing principles and efficient notification mechanisms.

## **Features**
- Fetches live NBA game scores using an external API.
- Sends formatted score updates to subscribers via SMS/Email using Amazon SNS.
- Scheduled automation for regular updates using Amazon EventBridge.
- Designed with security in mind, following the principle of least privilege for IAM roles.

## **Prerequisites**
- Free account with subscription and API Key at [sportsdata.io](https://sportsdata.io/)
- Personal AWS account with basic understanding of AWS and Python

## **Setup Instructions**

### **Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Farooqh103/MyDevProjects/edit/master/AWS-Projects/Terraform-Notifications_SNS_NBA.git
cd Terraform-Notifications_SNS_NBA
```
### Majority of this will be created in Terraform aside from the topic and the subscription.

### **Create an SNS Topic**
1. Open the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the SNS service.
3. Click Create Topic and select Standard as the topic type.
4. Name the topic (e.g., gd_topic) and note the ARN.
5. Click Create Topic.

### **Add Subscriptions to the SNS Topic**
1. After creating the topic, click on the topic name from the list.
2. Navigate to the Subscriptions tab and click Create subscription.
3. Select a Protocol:
- For Email:
  - Choose Email.
  - Enter a valid email address.

4. Click Create Subscription.
5. If you added an Email subscription:
- Check the inbox of the provided email address.
- Confirm the subscription by clicking the confirmation link in the email.
6. For SMS, the subscription will be immediately active after creation.

### Run Terraform

The terraform script created by me does the following
1. Allows SNS to publish giving it a policy
2. Creates an IAM Role
3. Creates a Lambda Function
4. Creates Eventbridge and the cron schedule
5. Assigns the Lambda Function the role
6. Lets Lambda use the Python code
7. Passes your security keys from .env.tfvars file to the variables within your terraform script which allows security
8. The keys also get passed through to lambda

### **Test the System**
1. Open the Lambda function in the AWS Management Console.
2. Create a test event to simulate execution.
3. Run the function and check CloudWatch Logs for errors.
4. Verify that SMS notifications are sent to the subscribed users.


### **What We Learned**
1. Designing a notification system with AWS SNS and Lambda.
2. Securing AWS services with least privilege IAM policies.
3. Automating workflows using EventBridge.
4. Integrating external APIs into cloud-based workflows.
5. Creating all of this using Terraform
